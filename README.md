# Metal-Gear-Square
Simple Javascript game

Get to the Square!! 

A simple javascript game to practice using the canvas attribute and practice my JavaScript coding skill.

The aim of the game is easy, using the a,w,s,d keys navigate your rectangle into the empty square to rack up your score. After you are successfull the square will move to a new location and you continue on your journey.

- a - Left
- w - Up
- s - Down
- d - Right

The bulk of this game was created following the Build Your First Javascript Game tutorial provided by Codecademy, can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3OnwkPOfY4&list=LLDFCbP-n-tbRe6yIdvfSXPA&index=3&t=0s

As extra work I managed to successfully get the score counter to work and increment everytime you get inside the square.

This is a desktop game only and will not work on mobile or tablet devices.
